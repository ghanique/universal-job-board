> [!QUESTION]  
> Should we have different kinds of users? Those that offer jobs and those that look for jobs? And how do we implement it? Do we give a User the Role of a Recruiter or the Role of a JobSeeker? And if he has one, can he also ask for the other (why shouldn't a Recruiter look for a different job?)?
